# RabbitMQ Check

This is a basic RabbitMQ check for Check_MK/OMD.

It currently only monitors queue depth and consumer count, but the agent
returns quite a bit more and the check will be expanded as time permits.

Example configuration file (/etc/check_mk/rabbitmq.cfg):

```python
servers = [
    {
				"address"  : "localhost",
				"port"     : 15672,
				"user"     : "rabbitmq",
				"password" : "supersekretive"
		},
]
```
